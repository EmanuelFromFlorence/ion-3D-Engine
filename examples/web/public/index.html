      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

              C is a procedural programming language.
              It was initially developed by Dennis
              Ritchie as a system programming
              language to write operating system.
              The main features of C language include
              low-level access to memory, simple set
              of keywords, and clean style, these
              features make C language suitable for
              system programming like operating system
              or compiler development.
